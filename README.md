# Jasper

Jellyfish based Assembly Sequence Polisher for Error Reduction
## Evaluate genome assemblies with Jellyfish and k-mers

(short description) 

## Dependency
* Python 3
* Jellyfish (https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish)



## Installation

### Stable Release

#### Direct installation 
1. Get a working Jellyfish and perform Python binding
See instructions in Jellyfish's manual (https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish)
2. The environment variable $PATH may need to be adjusted to add the path to the installed Jellyfish
3. Download the release version of Jasper
4. Then, for Python, the environment variable PYTHONPATH may need to be adjusted. For example:

    export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python2.7/site-packages



## Run
Options:\
  --db, the path to the .jf  database file. REQUIRED if --reads is not given.\
  --fix, output the index of fixed bases and output the new sequence.\
  -ff, --fixedfasta, the path to output the fixed assembly sequences. Default = fixed_seq.fasta. No use if --fix is not provided.\
  --fout, the path to output the index of the fixed bases (0-based). Default = fout.csv. No use if --fix is not provided.\
  --help,	display this help message.\
  -k, --ksize, the kmer size. Type = int. REQUIRED.\
  -q, --query, the path to the .fasta query file. REQUIRED.\
  --reads, the path to the .fasta file(sï¼‰containing the reads to build the jellyfish database. REQUIRED if --db is not given.\
  -rep_thre, the threshold  of occurrance for a kmer at a repeitive region. Type = int. If not provided, will be be calculated from the .jf file.\
  --test, output the indexes of bad kmers, total num of bad kmers, and an estimation for Q value.\
  -thre, --threshold, the threshold for a bad kmer. Type = int. If not provided, will be be calculated from the .jf file.\
  --tout, the path to output the locations of bad kmers (1-based). Default = tout.csv. No use if --test is not provided.\

*Note: 
1. One and only one between the contigs and database argument should be given.
2. If desired, the user can manually calculate the two thresholds from the Jellyfish histogram file:\
  jellyfish histo your.jf > your.histo \
  Look at the second column in the .histo file. Find the row of the first local minimum in the second column, then 0.5 times the value in the first column in this row is   the bad kmer threshold. \
  Then locate the glocal maximum in the second column among the rows below the bad kmer threshold row, then the 2 times the value in the first column in this row is the   repeititve region threshold 

Below is showing examples how to run Jasper (Each int represent an integer)\
If I have the reads to build the .jf file and would like the program to determine the two threshold. Also want both testing and fixing outputs\
```shell
python jasper.py --reads read1.fastq (read2.fastq, etc.)  --query assembly.fasta --ksize int --test --fix --fout fix.csv  --tout test.csv -ff fixed.fasta
```
If I have the reads to build the .jf file and want a specific repetitve region threshold (or bad kmer threshold, just providing the --threshold argument instead of -repthre)
```shell
python jasper.py --reads read1.fastq (read2.fastq, etc.) -rep_thre int --query assembly.fasta --ksize int --test --fix --fout fix.csv  --tout test.csv -ff fixed.fasta
```
If I have the .jf file already along with the two thresholds. Also want both testing and fixing outputs
```shell
python jasper.py --db mydb.jf  --threshold int -rep_thre int --query assembly.fasta --ksize int --test --fix --fout fix.csv  --tout test.csv -ff fixed.fasta 
```
